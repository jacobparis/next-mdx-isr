# Initial Setup

This template fetches content directly from your GitHub repository using Octokit. Here's how to configure it.

## Environment Variables

Add these to your Vercel project:

```bash
GITHUB_REPO_OWNER=your-username
GITHUB_REPO_NAME=your-repo
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx  # Optional
REVALIDATE_SECRET=your-random-string
```

### GitHub Token (Optional)

The token is only required if:
- Your repository is private
- You're hitting GitHub's API rate limit (60 req/hour without auth, 5000 with)

**Generate a Personal Access Token:**
1. GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. "Generate new token" with `repo` scope
3. Copy token immediately (you won't see it again)
4. Add as `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable

## Webhook Configuration

After deploying to Vercel:

1. **Repository → Settings → Webhooks → Add webhook**
2. **Payload URL**: `https://your-domain.com/api/revalidate`
3. **Content type**: `application/json`
4. **Secret**: Same value as `REVALIDATE_SECRET` env var
5. **Events**: "Just the push event"
6. **Active**: ✓

The webhook triggers ISR revalidation when you push content changes to the main branch.

## Create Content

Add MDX files to `content/` in your repo:

```mdx
---
title: "Post Title"
date: "2025-01-15"
description: "Brief description"
---

# Content here

Regular markdown works, plus custom components.
```

Push to main → webhook fires → content updates instantly via ISR.
```
